### Hi there 👋

My name is Joe Turner

I'm a software developer with experience in JavaScript (Express, React, Node.js). I have about a decade of experience as an automation controls engineer, designing complex systems and programming big machines in the industrial setting. I'm transitioning careers and pursuing my passion in programming. Thanks for visiting my repo!

🔭 I’m currently working on a "Grocery App"... this will allow the user to search for food items, compare nutritional info, save to favorites, and save to a grocery list. This utilizes the openfoodfacts API, React, and TBD for the backend (maybe MongoDB??)

🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB basics, and various data structure implementations.

🤔 I’m looking for help with networking, meeting people in the dev community, and finding opportunities where I may contribute 👍
